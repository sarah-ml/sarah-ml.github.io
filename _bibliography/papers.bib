  abstract={Brachytherapy is an effective choice for the treatment of cancer of various body sites, most commonly being cervical, breast and skin cancers. However, with the advancement in technology it is increasingly being used for many other body sites. Various algorithms have been developed for the calculation of dose distribution around the brachytherapy sources. Monte Carlo (MC) based calculations have been acknowledged presently as a valuable tool to provide dosimetric data for HDR sources used in Brachytherapy. As MC calculations produce accurate results with lesser uncertainties, it has been considered as a “gold standard” algorithm for dosimetric calculation in radiotherapy. <br>
  In this study, Monte Carlo simulation has been performed for Ir-192 HDR brachytherapy source. The EGSnrc code system was used to model the 192Ir source and the user code DOSRZnrc was used to simulate the dose distribution around the source. The dose calculation was done according to the AAPM TG-43U1 protocol. The dosimetric parameters such as dose rate constant, radial dose function and anisotropy function were calculated and the results of dosimetry parameters were compared and validated with the work carried out in Radiological Physics and Advisory Division, Mumbai and also with other published results.The calculated dosimetric parameters were in good agreement with the published values of similar Iridium HDR sources.The obtained value of dose rate constant for the source was in agreement with the otherstudies. <br>
  The values of the radial dose function and anisotropy function were plotted and compared with other studies. The overall statistical uncertainty was found to be < 0.2%},

I am pursuing Masterâ€™s in Medical Physics and currently working as a resident physicist in the department of Radiation Oncology at [Christian Medical College](https://www.cmch-vellore.edu) (CMC), Vellore, India. 

My research work with [Dr. Y Retna Ponmalar](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Y_Ponmalar) and [Dr. B Paul Ravindran](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=iIMrVggAAAAJ&hl=en) focuses on [Monte Carlo Simulation](#) for modeling and calculation of dosimetric parameters of [Iridium-192 HDR Brachytherapy](#) source. These codes help track the history of particle and allow the user to obtain data from the points where experimental measurements are very difficult. A similar Monte Carlo study is also being conducted for [CSA1 and CSA2 Cesium-137 LDR brachytherapy](#) sources.

My research interests involve Radiation physics, Monte Carlo simulation, Treatment Planning in Radiotherapy, Quality Assurance of treatment units and Radiation Protection.

Apart from this, I enjoy doing Hand Embroidery and creating Mandala Drawings. My works can be viewed on my [personal blog](#).
